        <p>Hello darkness my old friend</p>
        <p>Ive come to talk with you again</p>
        <p>For in visions soflty creeping</p>
        <p>Left it's seeds while i was sleeping</p>
        <p>And the vision, which was planted in my brain</p>
        <p>Still remains, within the sound of silence.</p>
        <p>In restless dreams i walked alone</p>
        <p>Narrow streets of cobbled stone</p>
        <p>'Neith the halo of a streetlamp</p>
        <p>i turned my collar to the coold and damp</p>
        <p>when my eyes were stamped by the flash of a neon light</p>
        <p>split the night, and touched the sound of silence.</p>
        <p>And in the naked light i saw</p>
        <p>10,000 people maybe more</p>
        <p>People talking without speaking</p>
        <p>People hearing without listening</p>
        <p>People writing songs, that no voice would ever share</p>
        <p>No-one would dare, disturb the sound of silence.</p>
        <p>'Fools.' said i. 'you do not know'</p>
        <p>'silence like a cancer growth'</p>
        <p>'Heed my words that i might teach you'</p>
        <p>'Take my arms that i might reach you'</p>
        <p>'But my words, like silent raindrops fell'</p>
        <p>'Echoing within the wells of silence'</p>
        <p>And the people bowed and prayed</p>
        <p>To the neon god they'd made</p>
        <p>And the sign flashed out its warning</p>
        <p>Of the words that it was forming</p>
        <p>And the sign said,</p>
        <p>the words of the prophets are written on subway walls, tenement halls</p>
        <p>Places steeped in the sounds of silence.</p>
